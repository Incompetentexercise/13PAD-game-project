# Space Game

An arcade game where you dodge asteroids in space.
Use `main.pyw` to run.

## How to Play
The difficulties are from green(easy) to black(extreme)  
Controls are in the instructions(?) menu. Press escape to pause the game. 
  
You can shoot the asteroids but beware that this takes away from your fuel.  
If you run out of fuel you will be unable to shoot and wont be able to change direction quickly.  
You can increase fuel by picking up the blue fuel capsules.

## Distribution
The `compile.bat` file creates an executable file for the game that includes all the python dependencies.
This requires the `images` and `sounds` folders to be in the same directory as the .exe  
So the game can be distributed as a zip of:  
```
-Main directory
	-images folder
	-sounds folder 
	-main.exe 
```
